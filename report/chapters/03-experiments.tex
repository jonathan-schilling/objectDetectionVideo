\chapter{Evaluation}\label{chpt:evaluation}

Two training tasks were executed for evaluation of the implemented system. The training settings as 
well as the results are discussed in this chapter.

\section{Experiments}\label{sec:eval:experiments}

The first neural network was trained, using the transfer learning concept. Starting point were the 
weights of the pre-trained \texttt{yolov5s} model. As described in section~\ref{subsec:app:training} 
the \texttt{freeze} option was applied to deactivate adaptation for the backbone. Using the small 
YOLOv5 model ten layer had to be frozen. The number of backbone layers can be found in the 
network configuration file in the YOLOv5 repository.
